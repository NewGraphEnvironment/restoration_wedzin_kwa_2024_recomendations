USERINPUT,Action,Details
NA,Water Quality Program,"Design long-term water monitoring program to leverage past work and attempt to quantify upstream water quality impacts via tools such as CABIN sampling program (Canada 2008), 5 sample in 30 day water quality sampling during both high and low flow periods (WLRS 2024; moE 2024), continuation/expansion of temperature monitoring Westcott (2022), quantify amounts of water withdrawn by licensees in the upper Bulkley catchment during the April to September low flow period, etc. Importantly, careful consideration of how to implement water quality program recommendations from Price (2014), Oliver (2020) and Westcott (2022) during this process is also recommended."
NA,Adapt Range Use to Reduce Aquatic Impacts,"Range use plans for areas overlapping high-value fish habitat need to be reviewed and revised to ensure they are well monitored, and their effectiveness can be openly documented. Incentivize and help coordinate range tenure practice improvements (off-site watering, rotational field use, riparian exclusion, monitoring, range use plan updates that reduce cattle load, range stewardship planning that includes ‘red’ zones for cattle exclusion, etc.) to reduce cattle impacts on riparian and water quality values. Cattle waste loading to tributary and mainstem habitats is of paramount concern as water quality degradation due to high biological oxygen demand related to nutrient loading will undermine the ability of aquatic life to recover from cumulative impacts in the watershed."
NA,Education Program Expansion,Leverage and expand existing education programs for youth related to watershed health and cultural/ecosystem significance of fish/riparian/wildlife values to provide outreach for all school-aged and post-secondary students in the greater Skeena region.
NA,Seed Collection Program,"Work with organizations such as the Woodmere Nursery, Skeena-based ‘Seed the North’, knowledge holders, and others to develop a local seed collection and propagation program to increase capacity for floodplain revegetation that can be scaled up to meet the challenges faced by historic removal of these native vegetation communities."
NA,Quantify and Promote Beaver Activity,"Working with watershed users—including industrial players like railways and highways, as well as landowners and range tenure holders—is essential for promoting water retention through beaver activity. The Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) can guide efforts by identifying areas where beaver activity can optimize water retention and flow regulation. Beavers are natural ecosystem engineers; their dams slow water flow, enhance groundwater recharge, and reduce flood risks, while also improving water quality by trapping sediments and filtering pollutants. Providing incentives to landowners and tenure holders to support water retention on the landscape can help catalyze beaver-influenced wetlands throughout the watershed, addressing potential land use conflicts while aligning ecological goals with economic interests. Encourage reporting of number of beavers trapped and killed by the railway, highways, trappers and landowners."
NA,Historic Fisheries Mapping,Spatially represent historic fisheries sites so the option is available that potential areas of restoration can be ranked according to their proximity to these sites.
NA,High Fisheries Value Areas,"Spatially delineate areas of high fisheries values based on known spawning and rearing habitat for fish species of interest. Where data gaps exist, develop study plans to understand where this high-value habitat is and quantify its value for fish species of interest through standardized methodologies such as Fish and Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures (Johnston and Slaney 1996). For known spawning and rearing locations, load reviewed data into bcfishpass using the user_habitat_classification.csv file located here so it can be pulled into the collaborative GIS project and queried to facilitate priority ranking of areas of high fisheries values."
