NA,"Design/implement a Long-term, Cost-effective Ecosystem Health Monitoring Strategy","As per Remington and Donas (2000) - design/implement a long-term, cost-effective ecosystem health monitoring strategy, incorporating water quality, periphyton, and benthic invertebrate bioassessment. Traditional ecological knowledge within this (and all project programs) plays a crucial role for understanding and managing ecosystems in the Neexdzi Kwah watershed.  Utilize tools such as CABIN sampling program (Canada 2008), 5 sample in 30 day water quality sampling during both high and low flow periods (WLRS 2024; moE 2024), continuation/expansion of temperature monitoring Westcott (2022), quantify amounts of water withdrawn by licensees in the upper Bulkley catchment during the April to September low flow period, etc. Importantly, careful consideration should be given with how to implement water quality program recommendations from Remington and Donas (2000), Price (2014), Oliver (2020) and Westcott (2022) during this process.",2025- foreseable future
NA,Adapt Range Use to Reduce Aquatic Impacts,"Range use plans for areas overlapping high-value fish habitat need to be reviewed and revised inclusively with Wet’suwet’en governments/communities to ensure they steward the local ecosystems, are well monitored, and their effectiveness can be openly documented. Incentivize and help coordinate range tenure practice improvements (off-site watering, rotational field use, riparian exclusion, monitoring, range use plan updates that reduce cattle load, range stewardship planning that includes ‘red’ zones for cattle exclusion, etc.) to educate wider audiences, icorperate traditional knowledge while reduceing cattle impacts on riparian and water quality values. Cattle waste loading to tributary and mainstem habitats is a key concern to be addressed as water quality degradation due to high biological oxygen demand related to nutrient loading will undermine the ability of aquatic life to recover from cumulative impacts in the watershed.",2025 - foreseable future
NA,Education Program Expansion,"Leverage and expand education programs related to watershed health and cultural/ecosystem significance of fish/riparian/wildlife values. Use project sites as the “universities/schools” to educate about Wet’suwet’en history, territory, culture, language, traditions and values.",2025 - foreseable future
NA,Floodplain and Riparian Recovery,"Restore habitat diversity and natural water flow in channelized areas by working with first nations, landowners, regulators, government agencies and industry to reconnect them to the floodplain.  Develop riparian recovery programs that educate and benefit local First Nations communities as well as landowners. Recover meaningfully sized buffer areas on key stream corridors while reducing erosion , minimizing unnatural sediment transfer and improving floodplain function.  Work with organizations such as the Woodmere Nursery, Skeena-based ‘Seed the North’, knowledge holders, and others to develop a local seed collection and propagation program to increase capacity for floodplain revegetation that can leverage cultural practices (foraging and herbal/medicinal plant collection) and be scaled up to meet the challenges faced by historic removal of native vegetation communities.",2025 - foreseable future
